This is code to remote-control a buggy using ROS.

You need to run

    ./configure
    make

before it can be used. After that run

    ./rospi-teleop

It currently doesn't install in a sensible way and can only be run from
this directory. This needs fixing...

The keyboard controls are WASD to move the buggy, arrow keys to change the
speed, space to stop and escape to quit. Clicking on the window will grab
the mouse; moving the mouse will then control the buggy. Click again to
release the mouse. If an XBox controller is plugged in when the program
starts then the LH analogue stick will control the buggy.

There is also a curses version, but it is currently broken.
